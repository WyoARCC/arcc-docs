# ARCC Documentation

This repository is a home where ARCC can provide documentation which our users
can clone the repository and request that a change be made via a github pull
request. 


All documents must be written in Markdown at this point. We plan to use a 
continuous integration (CI) tool to push documentation to parts on our wiki at
a later time.
